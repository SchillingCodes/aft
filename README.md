## Description
The idea of this project is to build a web app that displays the average job pay / living costs for locations searched by the user. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statics (https://www.bls.gov/) API is to be used to gather the necessary data. Development stopped due to the API not having a streamlined process to query for cities.
